<!-- 
    Pseudocode Plan:

    Ask the user to enter a square size between 3 and 30.
    Continuously prompt the user to enter a number within the specified range if they input a number outside of the acceptable range.
    Don't worry about non-numeric input, assume the user will type a number.
    Using prompt() to get user input.
    Draw a square of the specified size.  For example, if a size of 5 is requested, you'd draw this:
        *****
        *****
        *****
        *****
        *****
